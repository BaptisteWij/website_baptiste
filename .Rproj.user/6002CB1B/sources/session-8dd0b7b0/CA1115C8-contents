                Hi! My name is Baptiste Wijas. I am a Post Doctoral Fellow in Amy Zanne's lab at the University of Miami. I have a particular research interest in landscape ecology and am interested in the interactions that shape biodiversity and ecosystem functions. My research focuses on wood decomposition processes, herbivory, food webs, drylands and invertebrate detritivores such as termites.
